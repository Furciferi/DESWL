setup_output runs run_psfex.pt, only setting up the directory structure
go runs run_psfex.py, runs findstars and psfex
relink runs run_psfex.py, skipping the findstars and psfex steps and just relinks files
sync_to_nersc copies the psfex files and blacklist over to nersc
exp runs build_exp_catalog.py, builds the catalog of information about exposures
cats runs build_psf_cats.py, builds catalogs of PSF information for each exposure
rho runs run_rho.py, computes the rho statistics for each exposure/ccd
rho2 runs run_rho2.py, computes the rho statistics for the full data and each filter
plots runs plot_rho.py, makes plots

v3 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 50
v4 uses degree 2,2, switched FEW_STARS to 20
v5 uses degree 2,2, max_mag = 16
v6 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 1, PSF_SIZE = 51,51

psf = normal psf cats
psf2 has Erin's psfex model as erin_*
psf3 uses lanczos 5 instead of 3 in GalSim des module
psf4 uses 16x16 stamps rather than 32x32
psf5 subtracts off the sky estimated from a 2 pixel border around stamp
