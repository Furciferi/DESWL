make_explist pulls out the relevant exposures from the meds files
setup_output runs run_psfex.py, only setting up the directory structure
go runs run_psfex.py, runs findstars and psfex
relink runs run_psfex.py, skipping the findstars and psfex steps and just relinks files
sync_to_nersc copies the psfex files and blacklist over to nersc
exp runs build_exp_catalog.py, builds the catalog of information about exposures
cats runs build_psf_cats.py, builds catalogs of PSF information for each exposure
rho runs run_rho.py, computes the rho statistics for each exposure/ccd
rho2 runs run_rho2.py, computes the rho statistics for the full data and each filter
plots runs plot_rho.py, makes plots
mag runs plot_mag.py, makes other plots

v3 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 50
v4 uses degree 2,2, switched FEW_STARS to 20
v5 uses degree 2,2, max_mag = 16
v6 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 1, PSF_SIZE = 51,51
v7 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 0.2, PSF_SIZE = 251,251

psf = normal psf cats
psf2 has Erin's psfex model as erin_*
psf3 uses lanczos 5 instead of 3 in GalSim des module
psf4 uses 16x16 stamps rather than 32x32
psf5 subtracts off the sky estimated from a 2 pixel border around stamp

Y1A1 testbed:
v8 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 0.5, PSF_SIZE = 101,101

Y1A1:
v1 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 0.5, PSF_SIZE = 101,101
   It was agreed that going forward the tag should look like y1a1-v01.
y1a1-v02 is like v1 except:
         BASIS_TYPE=PIXEL (not PIXEL_AUTO) as suggested by Emmanuel.
         GAIN=4 (not 2) which is closer to the real values, which vary around 4.0
y1a1-v03 is like v02 except:
         degree 3,3
y1a1-v04 is like v02 except:
         Only run on DES0224-0541
y1a1-v05 is only run on DES2305-0124
         Uses desdm psfex file
y1a1-v06 is like v05 except:
         Does the same star selection (B/F, tape bumps) as usual
y1a1-v07 is like v06 except:
         PSF_SAMPLING    0.5
         PSF_SIZE        101,101

Notes for Y2:
GAIN -> 1.  Images are in e-, not ADU.
