This is work in progress.
Needs numpy, astropy, matplotlib

For now, make two directories with sets of FITS files in from different runs.  Run comparison tests with:
> python -m wltest dirname1 dirname2

You get some test results and some plots.  The code expects im3shape column names for now but easy to change.

How to add tests
----------------

If it is a test that can be run on a single catalog it goes in wltest/single_tests.py.  If it requires two catalogs (because you match up galaxies and compare) then wltest/pair_tests.py.  Once it's written you should add it to the list of classes in GreenSuite at the top of wltest/suite.py

The first test in wltest/single_tests.py shows a minimal example of a single-catalog test.  It needs to define a name, names of stats it will calculate, and a target value for those statistics to be less than in absolute.  The "run" method should then calculate and return the calculated statistic.

If you want to make plots in the run method then use the two methods:
	filename = self.filename("root_of_plot_name")
	self.figure(filename)
and then use ordinary pylab plot commands.  They will be saved automatically.



Ideally this would contain all the really important tests:

+ mean shear consistent with zero
+ no mean shear in bins of:
- psf_e
- snr
- radius
+ tangential shear around stars
+ tangential shear around center of fov
+ tangential shear around random positions
+ star ellipticity - galaxy ellipticity correlation function
+ Compare shear around LRGs for the two shear methods
+ Compare shear around LRGs for two different filters
+ B-modes
+ changes 2-pt functions re-done with different cuts (S/N, masking, ...)
+ redshift dependence of galaxy-galaxy data for fixed lens population vary source bin ???
+ Rowe statistics on full area
