This is work in progress.
Needs numpy, astropy, matplotlib

For now, make two directories with sets of FITS files in from different runs.  Run comparison tests with:
> python -m wltest dirname1 dirname2

You get some test results and some plots.  The code expects im3shape column names for now but easy to change.
