This is work in progress.
Needs numpy, astropy, matplotlib

For now, make two directories with sets of FITS files in from different runs.  Run comparison tests with:
> python -m wltest dirname1 dirname2

You get some test results and some plots.  The code expects im3shape column names for now but easy to change.

Ideally this would contain all the really important tests:

+ mean shear consistent with zero
+ no mean shear in bins of:
- psf_e
- snr
- radius
+ tangential shear around stars
+ tangential shear around center of fov
+ tangential shear around random positions
+ star ellipticity - galaxy ellipticity correlation function
+ Compare shear around LRGs for the two shear methods
+ Compare shear around LRGs for two different filters
+ B-modes
+ changes 2-pt functions re-done with different cuts (S/N, masking, ...)
+ redshift dependence of galaxy-galaxy data for fixed lens population vary source bin ???
+ Rowe statistics on full area
