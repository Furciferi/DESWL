TODO:
Fix reserved in psf_cat files.  The reserved stars seem not to have made it in.
Get other kinds of blacklisting to put in as flags in expinfo
airmass, tiling, etc. still not in exposure_info catalogs.

make_explist pulls out the relevant exposures from the meds files
setup_output runs run_psfex.py, only setting up the directory structure
go runs run_psfex.py, runs findstars and psfex
- Use verify.py to verify that all files were either made or blacklisted.
relink runs run_psfex.py, skipping the findstars and psfex steps and just relinks files
sync_to_nersc copies the psfex files and blacklist over to nersc
exp runs build_exp_catalog.py, builds the catalog of information about exposures
cats runs build_psf_cats.py, builds catalogs of PSF information for each exposure
rho runs run_rho.py, computes the rho statistics for each exposure/ccd
rho2 runs run_rho2.py, computes the rho statistics for the full data and each filter
plots runs plot_rho.py, makes plots
mag runs plot_mag.py, makes other plots

Y3:
y3a1-v02    Basic Piff run with pixel grid and basispoly, order=3
y3a1-v03    Fixed a bunch of findstars failures.  Also use ngmix for measurements.
y3a1-v04    Same as v03 but with hsm


v3 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 50
v4 uses degree 2,2, switched FEW_STARS to 20
v5 uses degree 2,2, max_mag = 16
v6 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 1, PSF_SIZE = 51,51
v7 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 0.2, PSF_SIZE = 251,251

psf = normal psf cats
psf2 has Erin's psfex model as erin_*
psf3 uses lanczos 5 instead of 3 in GalSim des module
psf4 uses 16x16 stamps rather than 32x32
psf5 subtracts off the sky estimated from a 2 pixel border around stamp

Y1A1 testbed:
v8 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 0.5, PSF_SIZE = 101,101

Y1A1:
v1 uses degree 2,2, FEW_STARS = 20, max_mag = 17, PSF_SAMP = 0.5, PSF_SIZE = 101,101
   It was agreed that going forward the tag should look like y1a1-v01.
y1a1-v02 is like v1 except:
         BASIS_TYPE=PIXEL (not PIXEL_AUTO) as suggested by Emmanuel.
         GAIN=4 (not 2) which is closer to the real values, which vary around 4.0
y1a1-v03 is like v02 except:
         degree 3,3
y1a1-v04 is like v02 except:
         Only run on DES0224-0541
y1a1-v05 is only run on DES2305-0124
         Uses desdm psfex file
y1a1-v06 is like v05 except:
         Does the same star selection (B/F, tape bumps) as usual
y1a1-v07 is like v06 except:
         PSF_SAMPLING   0.5
         PSF_SIZE       101,101
y1a1-v08 is like v06 except:
         PSF_SAMPLING   1.0
         PSF_SIZE       51,51
y1a1-v09 is like v06 except:
         PSF_SAMPLING   0.0  (auto)
         PSF_SIZE       51,51
y1a1-v10 is like v02 except:
         PSF_SIZE       51,51
         so far, run on y1s82 test bed
y1a1-v11 is like v02 except:
         PSF_SIZE       51,51
         INTERPW        8
         INTERPFAC      4
         (recompiled PSFEx to get the last two)
         so far, run on y1s82 test bed
y1a1-v12 is our first run with Piff. 
         stamp_size = 25
         scale = 0.2
         size = 17
         start_sigma = 0.8
         order = 3
         nsigma = 4
y1a1-v13 is like v02 except:
         reseve 20% of the stars for more accurate rho stats.
